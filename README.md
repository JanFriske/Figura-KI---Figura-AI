## Technical Implementation

### Python and Mojo
- **Python**: Used for flexible orchestration tasks such as data manipulation, analysis, and general system management.
- **Mojo**: Utilized for performance-intensive processes and critical algorithms to ensure high-speed computations.

#### Example Code: Connecting CE and SSASE Containers

**Python Script (container_connection.py)**
```python
import docker
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

# Initialize Docker client
client = docker.from_env()

# Function to start a container
def start_container(image_name, network):
    return client.containers.run(image_name, detach=True, network=network)

# Start CE containers
atlas_container = start_container("figuraai/atlas", "core_network")
socrates_container = start_container("figuraai/socrates", "core_network")

# Start SSASE containers
goliath_container = start_container("figuraai/goliath", "ssase_network")
amschel_container = start_container("figuraai/amschel", "ssase_network")

# Kafka producer to send messages between containers
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='kafka:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Example message from Atlas to Goliath
message = {'source': 'atlas', 'target': 'goliath', 'data': 'Process Control Command'}
producer.send('process_control_topic', value=message)
```

**Mojo Script (api_communication.mojo)**
```mojo
import Kafka

struct APICommunication {
    var producer: Kafka.Producer

    public init() {
        self.producer = Kafka.Producer(bootstrap_servers="kafka:9092")
    }

    public func send_message(topic: String, message: String) {
        self.producer.send(topic, value=message)
    }
}

// Example usage
var api_comm = APICommunication()
api_comm.send_message(topic="data_analysis_topic", message='{"source": "socrates", "target": "hypocrates", "data": "Medical Data"}')
```

### Docker and Kubernetes Integration
Figura AI uses Docker to containerize each building block, ensuring they are portable and scalable. Containers within the same engine communicate over dedicated networks, while inter-engine communication is handled via Apache Kafka.

#### Example Docker-Compose File (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  atlas:
    image: figuraai/atlas
    networks:
      - core_network

  socrates:
    image: figuraai/socrates
    networks:
      - core_network

  goliath:
    image: figuraai/goliath
    networks:
      - ssase_network

  amschel:
    image: figuraai/amschel
    networks:
      - ssase_network

networks:
  core_network:
    driver: bridge
  ssase_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### System Requirements
Figura AI is designed to run in environments with substantial computational power, typically a data center or an experimental network party of enthusiasts and tech-savvy friends. Each model, specifically tuned for each block, must be loaded into the GPU's memory due to the performance benefits of GPU-based computations.

#### Infrastructure Considerations:
- **Data Center**: Requires powerful hardware with multiple GPUs.
- **Network Party**: Leverages a cluster of high-performance personal computers connected via a network.

### User Interface
The Figura System is built from all engines, and user interaction is facilitated through the **Figura Vision** block. This block generates video content and creates the virtual persona of Figura AI, providing a user interface named "Figura" for users to interact with the system.
