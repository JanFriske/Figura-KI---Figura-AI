# Figura AI - A Modular and Dynamic Open-Source Advanced Artificial Intelligence System

Welcome to Figura AI, an innovative open-source project aimed at creating a sophisticated and versatile artificial intelligence system. Figura AI comprises multiple 'engines' and 'building blocks,' each with unique functionalities that collaborate to achieve complex tasks. The system leverages the power of over 72 building blocks, each equipped with specialized GGUF (General Graphical User Framework) models for high-performance processing.

## Overview

Figura AI is designed as a modular system, where each module performs a specific task. This design allows for efficient and scalable operations, enabling new functionalities to be added or existing ones modified without disrupting the entire system. The project utilizes both Python and Mojo, two powerful programming languages, to optimize performance and flexibility.

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture
Figura AI is built around five main engines:
1. **Core Engine (CE)**: Manages and controls core AI processing capabilities.
2. **System-Sequence and Stability Engine (SSASE)**: Ensures seamless execution, coordination, and stability of all processes within the system.
3. **Investigation Engine (IE)**: Handles autonomous data investigation and analysis.
4. **Sequence Engine (SE)**: Manages practical execution tasks such as machine control, hologram creation, and other system procedures.
5. **Combination Engine (IE/SE)**: A hybrid engine capable of both autonomous investigations and system process management.

### Building Blocks
Each engine is composed of several building blocks, each responsible for specialized functions. For example:
- **CE (Core Engine)** includes Atlas, Socrates, Solomon, Joshua, and Assisi.
- **SSASE** includes David, Goliath, Amschel, Monk, Hermes, Kryptor, Cerebro, Supermodel, Commissioner, Brutus, Arminius, Lancelot, Merlin, Heracles, Chronist, Chronos, Resonator, and Stabilizer.

## Technical Implementation

### Python and Mojo
- **Python**: Used for flexible orchestration tasks such as data manipulation, analysis, and general system management.
- **Mojo**: Utilized for performance-intensive processes and critical algorithms to ensure high-speed computations.

#### Example Code: Connecting CE and SSASE Containers

**Python Script (container_connection.py)**
```python
import docker
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

# Initialize Docker client
client = docker.from_env()

# Function to start a container
def start_container(image_name, network):
    return client.containers.run(image_name, detach=True, network=network)

# Start CE containers
atlas_container = start_container("figuraai/atlas", "core_network")
socrates_container = start_container("figuraai/socrates", "core_network")

# Start SSASE containers
goliath_container = start_container("figuraai/goliath", "ssase_network")
amschel_container = start_container("figuraai/amschel", "ssase_network")

# Kafka producer to send messages between containers
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='kafka:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Example message from Atlas to Goliath
message = {'source': 'atlas', 'target': 'goliath', 'data': 'Process Control Command'}
producer.send('process_control_topic', value=message)
```

**Mojo Script (api_communication.mojo)**
```mojo
import Kafka

struct APICommunication {
    var producer: Kafka.Producer

    public init() {
        self.producer = Kafka.Producer(bootstrap_servers="kafka:9092")
    }

    public func send_message(topic: String, message: String) {
        self.producer.send(topic, value=message)
    }
}

// Example usage
var api_comm = APICommunication()
api_comm.send_message(topic="data_analysis_topic", message='{"source": "socrates", "target": "hypocrates", "data": "Medical Data"}')
```

### Docker and Kubernetes Integration
Figura AI uses Docker to containerize each building block, ensuring they are portable and scalable. Containers within the same engine communicate over dedicated networks, while inter-engine communication is handled via Apache Kafka.

#### Example Docker-Compose File (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  atlas:
    image: figuraai/atlas
    networks:
      - core_network

  socrates:
    image: figuraai/socrates
    networks:
      - core_network

  goliath:
    image: figuraai/goliath
    networks:
      - ssase_network

  amschel:
    image: figuraai/amschel
    networks:
      - ssase_network

networks:
  core_network:
    driver: bridge
  ssase_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### System Requirements
Figura AI is designed to run in environments with substantial computational power, typically a data center or an experimental network party of enthusiasts and tech-savvy friends. Each model, specifically tuned for each block, must be loaded into the GPU's memory due to the performance benefits of GPU-based computations.

#### Infrastructure Considerations:
- **Data Center**: Requires powerful hardware with multiple GPUs.
- **Network Party**: Leverages a cluster of high-performance personal computers connected via a network.

### User Interface
The Figura System is built from all engines, and user interaction is facilitated through the **Figura Vision** block. This block generates video content and creates the virtual persona of Figura AI, providing a user interface named "Figura" for users to interact with the system.
