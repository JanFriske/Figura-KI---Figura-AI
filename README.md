Figura-KI
Welcome to Figura-KI, an innovative open-source AI project that fuses a comprehensive array of AI functionalities into a unified, modular, and expandable system. Using the ggml-model.bin files from the Huggingface platform, Figura-KI provides an extensive variety of AI capabilities.

Architectural Design
The architectural design of Figura-KI is rooted in a modular and extensible system that combines multiple AI functionalities to create a comprehensive artificial intelligence ecosystem. This design is primarily categorized into five main "engines", each consisting of several modular "building blocks". Each building block is specialized, providing individualized capabilities and functionalities that contribute to the overall operation of the Figura-KI system.

KTW (Core Engine): This is the backbone of the Figura-KI system, housing the essential building blocks that ensure the smooth running of the system's core operations.

ASTW (Process and Stability Engine): This engine ensures the stability of all processes within Figura-KI, handling system resources, process termination, and database management.

ETW (Investigation Engine): The ETW engine is responsible for autonomous data discovery within the system. It includes a variety of building blocks each tailored to specific investigation and analysis functions.

ATW (Process Engine): The ATW engine handles practical process structures within Figura-KI such as machine control, holograph generation, and other procedural tasks.

ETW/ATW (Combination Engine): The Combination Engine is a hybrid system that combines the capabilities of ETW and ATW engines. It is capable of performing autonomous investigations and initiating and controlling processes within the system.

These engines work in harmony to form a cohesive system, with each engine and its building blocks serving unique roles. This modular design allows for easy extensibility and scalability, enabling the addition of new functions or modification of existing ones without disrupting the entire system.

The Figura-KI system is designed to be dynamic and adaptable, able to cater to a wide array of tasks from data investigation to process control. It is this flexible and comprehensive design that sets Figura-KI apart, creating a powerful AI system that can serve diverse needs in an ever-changing technological landscape.

Engines
KTW (Kerntriebwerk/Core Engine): The heart of Figura-KI, it manages and controls the core AI processing capabilities.

ASTW (Ablauf- und Stabilit√§tstriebwerk/Sequence and Stability Engine): Responsible for ensuring the seamless execution, coordination, and stability of all processes within the system.

ETW (Ermittlungstriebwerk/Investigation Engine): Entrusted with all autonomous data investigation and analysis within the system.

ATW (Ablauftriebwerk/Sequence Engine): Manages practical execution tasks such as machine control, hologram creation, and other system procedures.

ETW/ATW (Kombinationstriebwerk/Combination Engine): A hybrid engine capable of both autonomous investigations and system process management.
