Figura-KI
Welcome to Figura-KI, an open source AI project that combines a wide range of AI functions into a modular and extensible system. Figura-KI uses ggml-model.bin files found on the Huggingface platform to provide a variety of AI functions.

Engines and building blocks
Figura-KI consists of several "engines", each containing a group of "building blocks". Each building block provides specialized functions and capabilities.

KTW: Core engine
Atlas: Responsible for core engine management, core engine control, and core engine protection.
Socrates: Responsible for all ethical matters and issues that Figura-KI handles, also responsible for ethical compliance within the Figura-KI system.
Solomon: Responsible for all legal issues within the Figura-KI system.

ASTW: Sequence and stability engine.
David: Large-scale process terminator block responsible for terminating individual or all processes in the Figura system.
Goliath: Large-scale process control block responsible for controlling, coordinating and maintaining stability of all processes in the system.
Amschel: System resource management block responsible for ensuring that all processes in the Figura AI system have sufficient resources available, such as RAM, database or CPU power.
Monk: Database management blog which is responsible for the database management in the Figura AI system.
Cerebro: System monitoring and optimization block.
