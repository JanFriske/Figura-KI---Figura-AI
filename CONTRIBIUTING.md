Contributing to Figura-AI
First of all, thank you for considering contributing to Figura-AI! We appreciate your time and expertise and are excited to see this project grow with the help of talented individuals like you.

This open-source project is constantly evolving and we are keen on building a community that supports and enhances the capabilities of Figura-KI. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds. This document provides a set of guidelines to get you started on your journey as a Figura-KI contributor.

Getting Started
Understand the Project: Before you start contributing, we recommend that you spend some time understanding the architecture and purpose of Figura-AI. Review the README.md file and the project's Wiki page for a comprehensive overview of the project.

Set Up the Environment: Clone the Figura-AI repository from Github and set up your development environment. Refer to the setup instructions in the README.md file.

Pick an Issue: Browse through the open issues listed on the Figura-AI Github page. Each issue provides a description of the problem, and you can choose one that aligns with your skills or interests. If you have any queries or need clarification on any issue, feel free to comment.

Making Contributions
Fork the Repository: Create a fork of the Figura-AI repository to your Github account. This will provide you a copy of the repository that you can modify without affecting the original code.

Branch Out: Create a new branch on your forked repository to isolate your changes. This helps maintain a clean and manageable commit history.

Code!: Make your changes or additions to the code. Ensure that you follow the coding standards and guidelines specific to Figura-KI, which can be found in the Code_of_Conduct.md file.

Commit and Push: Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message, explaining the changes you've made. Then, push your changes to your forked repository.

Pull Request: Once you've pushed your changes, create a pull request (PR) on the original Figura-AI repository. Your PR should clearly outline what you've changed and why. If your PR resolves an open issue, be sure to link it in the description.

Review Process
After submitting your pull request, our team will review your contribution. We aim to review and respond to all PRs in a timely manner. We may provide feedback or ask for changes before merging your code. Don't be discouraged if your code isn't accepted in its current form--often, the review process leads to an even better outcome!

Final Notes
We encourage you to ask questions and communicate openly. We believe that every question, no matter how small, can lead to great learning opportunities.

Remember, the goal is to create a high-quality, powerful, and user-friendly AI system. Your contributions, no matter how small, can help achieve this goal.

We look forward to your contributions and are excited to see how your work will improve Figura-AI!

Note: This contribution guideline is subject to updates and changes as the project evolves.
