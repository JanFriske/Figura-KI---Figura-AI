**Contribution Guidelines for Figura-AI**

Welcome to the Figura-AI project! We're excited to have you join our community of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who are working together to create a unique, high-performance, multifunctional, and universal artificial intelligence system. Your contribution will help shape the future of artificial intelligence and enable the development of advanced technologies that can benefit society.

To ensure a smooth collaboration experience, we've put together these guidelines to help you understand how you can contribute to the project and become an integral part of the Figura-AI community.

**Getting Started**

Fork the repository: Start by forking the Figura-AI repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository that you can work on independently.

Clone your fork: Clone your forked repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on the project locally and make changes to the code.

Create a branch: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on. This keeps the main branch clean and ensures that your changes won't conflict with others.
