# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

1. **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, including offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following (online or in person), harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
2. **Insults**: Insults, put-downs, or derogatory comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other protected characteristics.
3. **Public or Private Harassment**: Public or private harassment is not acceptable. This includes reporting such behavior to the projectâ€™s maintainers.
4. **Trolling**: Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks are not welcome in any form.
5. **Off-Topic Messages**: Off-topic messages that do not contribute to discussions.
6. **Inappropriate Jokes or Content**: Inappropriate jokes, especially those related to sensitive topics such as sexual violence, discrimination, or harassment.
7. **Disrespectful Behavior**: Disrespectful behavior towards other contributors and maintainers.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and being responsive to any reported incidents. Project maintainers have the authority and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details on specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community.
